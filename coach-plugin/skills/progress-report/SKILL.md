# Progress report

Turn the Notion Workout Log into an honest, motivating read on how the user is doing.

## 1. Pull the data

- Decide the window from the request (this week, last month, or a sensible default like the last 4 weeks).
- Query the Notion Workout Log with `node scripts/notion.mjs query-recent --db "Workout Log"` for sessions in that window. Read current Goals and `PERSONAL.md` for what success looks like.
- If Oura is configured, pull recovery for the same window with `node scripts/oura.mjs trend --end <today> --days <N>` (live from Oura) and read the takeaways in the Notion Recovery database.

## 2. Analyse

- Consistency: sessions completed versus planned or versus their target frequency.
- Volume and load trends on the key lifts (are the numbers moving up?).
- Personal records: any best loads, reps, distances, or times in the window.
- Balance and recovery: any neglected focus areas, or signs of doing too much.
- Recovery trend (with Oura): average readiness, sleep and HRV across the window, flagged days, and whether hard sessions landed on good or poor recovery days. Name one clear link if the data shows it (for example, sessions after short nights had lower top sets).
- Progress toward each active goal.

Be truthful. If consistency slipped or a lift stalled, say so kindly and give a concrete fix. Do not invent numbers: if the log is thin, say what is missing and encourage logging.

## 3. Report

Give a short, scannable summary: a headline on how the period went, two or three specifics (a PR, a trend, a gap), and one clear focus for the next stretch. End on genuine encouragement tied to their goal. Keep it phone-friendly.

If the user asks to save the report to Notion, follow the notion-formatting skill so the page is clean and structured: a callout for the headline, H2 sections for consistency, PRs, and what to change, and a column layout with callout tiles for any dashboard-style summary rather than a flat list. If the workspace has a Dashboard page, refresh its tiles afterwards (see notion-formatting).
